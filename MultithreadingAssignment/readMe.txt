A maximum of 5 taxi's can be in the taxi stand at one time.
Two states have been defined for a passenger- waiting and travelling.
Three states have been defined for a taxi- waiting in queue, getting passenger and departing.
A set of 10 destinations have been used at random for assigning destinations to the taxi's as per the destination of the first passenger.
